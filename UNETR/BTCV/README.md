# Model Overview
A transformer-based model for volumetric (3D) multi-organ segmentation task using the BTCV challenge dataset. This model is trained using the UNETR architecture [1].

### Tutorial

A step-by-step tutorial can be found in:

tutorial/unetr_btcv_segmentation_3d.ipynb

### Installing Dependencies
Dependencies can be installed using:
``` bash
./requirements.sh
```

### Training command
A typical training command is as follows:
``` bash
python __main__.py --batch_size=2 --opt=adamw --pos_embedd="perceptron" --loss_type="dice_ce" --num_steps=20000 --name=test --lrdecay
```
**NOTE**: You may need to adjust batch size. Batch sizes of 2 and 1 require 16G and 9G VRAM respectively on 32G V100 GPUs. Refer to commands for more details.  

## Dataset
The training data is from the [BTCV challenge dataset](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3193805/wiki/217752).

Under Institutional Review Board (IRB) supervision, 50 abdomen CT scans of were randomly selected from a combination of an ongoing colorectal cancer chemotherapy trial, and a retrospective ventral hernia study. The 50 scans were captured during portal venous contrast phase with variable volume sizes (512 x 512 x 85 - 512 x 512 x 198) and field of views (approx. 280 x 280 x 280 mm3 - 500 x 500 x 650 mm3). The in-plane resolution varies from 0.54 x 0.54 mm2 to 0.98 x 0.98 mm2, while the slice thickness ranges from 2.5 mm to 5.0 mm. 

- Target: 13 abdominal organs including 1. Spleen 2. Right Kidney 3. Left Kideny 4.Gallbladder 5.Esophagus 6. Liver 7. Stomach 8.Aorta 9. IVC 10. Portal and Splenic Veins 11. Pancreas 12.Right adrenal gland 13.Left adrenal gland.
- Task: Segmentation
- Modality: CT  
- Size: 30 3D volumes (24 Training + 6 Testing)  
- Size: BTCV MICCAI Challenge

## Inference Details
Inference is performed in a sliding window manner with a specified stride.
