**MONAI Research Contributions** is a platform built to showcase cutting-edge research utilizing MONAI. This enables the community to see MONAI “in action” and  researchers to gain visibility for their MONAI-based work. The repository is regularly reviewed and selected contributions that have demonstrated their popularity or relevance can be integrated into MONAI components in a second step. Contributions are welcome! Simply follow the contribution guidelines stated below and file a pull request.

**Contribution Guidelines:**

1. Contributions are required to be published and have successfully undergone peer-review (If the contributing person is not the author of the work, no approval from the authors of the paper is required, but the contribution needs to be clearly labeled as a “Third-party contribution”).

2. The implementation is required to feature MONAI components to a substantial extent.

3. The implementation is required to include a boilerplate shell script (to be published) allowing code-reviewers to execute the code and reproduce the paper’s results with one click.

4. Under the hood, code quality does not have to match standards of the MONAI main repository, as the Research Contribution repository aims at a fast track for code change proposals and demonstrating cutting-edge research ideas.

5. New contributions will be given a MONAI version tag (visible in the associated Readme) according to the utilized version of MONAI. This avoids the need to maintain compatibility of contributions for following MONAI releases.
